        <div class="timer">30:00</div>
        <p>Now take a moment and think about how you experience your pain on a day-to-day basis.
            It might help to think of a recent moment, a critical life moment, or a moment when the pain was particularly high.
             Think of pain signals like alarm bells that get set off.
              What alarm bells get set off for you in these moments in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. when you experience pain. 
              Include in your description what comes to you in these moments, including images and/or thoughts of people, places, and things that become notable during the identified pain moment. 
              It is important to include specifics of what happened during the specific pain moment you are describing and how you felt or what you were thinking when that event occurred. 
              This is where details matter to fully understand your pain experience and its emotional impact. 
              Think of what you saw, heard, smelled, and/or touched. Do not worry about your grammar or spelling, and do not worry if you run out of time, just write for the full 30 minutes.
